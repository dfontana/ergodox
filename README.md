# Erogodox Mappings

Keymappings for ergodox/iris keyboards. These are backups/quick access points. The Wally tool provided by ergodox-ez can be used to flash either keyboard.

## Configuring

Visit the [QMK Config Tool](https://config.qmk.fm/#/keebio/iris/rev4/LAYOUT) and upload the link to the raw `keymap.json` file for the board being modified. Make sure the right board is picked (`keebio/iris/rev4` or `ergodox_ez`)

Once ready, download both the map & firmware for persisting here

## Flashing

Plugin board, boot Wally, pick hex, hit reset.
